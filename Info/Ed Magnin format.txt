Song table
=======================================
The song table is comprised of 16-bit pointers to each song. It is usually found using the following commands:

ld bc, SongTable
sla a
add c
ld c, a
jr nc, $????
inc b
ld a, [bc]

Which equals the following in hex:
CA xx xx 01 ?? ?? CB 27 81 4F

Song header
=======================================
The song header is structured as follows (note that pointers are relative):
1-2. Channel 1 pointer
3-4. Channel 2 pointer
5-6. Channel 3 pointer
7-8. Channel 4 pointer

Song structure
=======================================
Each song is comprised of a series of 5-byte events, structured as follows:
1-2. Time
3. Note (if 0, then end of song)
4. Volume?
5. Note size/duty

To calculate the note size, the following code is used:
and a, $7F
srl a
srl a
srl a
srl a
jr nz, $02
or a, $01
or b

Gremlin variant
=======================================
Two games developed by Gremlin, Brainbender and Dirty Racin', use a modified version of the driver with a very much reworked sequence format. In this version, song headers work as follows:
1-2. Channel 1 pointer
3-4. Channel 1 transpose
5-6. Channel 2 pointer
7-8. Channel 3 transpose
9-10. Channel 3 pointer
11-12. Channel 3 transpose
13-14. Channel 4 pointer
15-16. Channel 4 transpose

Song events are structured as follows:
1. Time
2. Note
3. Instrument/envelope (Dirty Racin' for channel 1-3 only)

Note that using this version of the driver, the length of songs are limited. Longer songs are created by playing multiple songs sequentially.
